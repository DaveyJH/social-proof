## My process

### Built with

- VS Code
- CSS/HTML only
- Mobile-first design process

### What I learned

I learned about the flex property and attributes.

I also learned that an iPhone XR does NOT work with these sizes!  Many hours of headbanging later.


### Continued development

- I still have some problems copying the text accurately with the given font-weight values.  In particular, I am struggling to get text to resize within its containing element.  I don't know if this is possible in CSS and HTML alone.
